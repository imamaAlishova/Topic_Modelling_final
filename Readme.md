 
## “What are the most discussed themes in articles on Special Needs Education?”

My research idea was to select fifty articles from the category of “most read articles” from "European Journal 
of Special Needs Education, Volume 37, Issue 6 (2022)",(https://www.tandfonline.com/action/showOpenAccess?journalCode=rejs20)
and make topic modeling with LDA. The research question is “What are the most discussed themes/topics in articles on 
Special Needs Education?”. I was particularly interested in the topics of the parental involvement in the teaching of 
special needs children and to find out the most prominent issues in special needs education across European countries. 
I ended up having only fifteen articles as a dataset due to the open access restriction.Therefore, I changed the category 
from “most read” to “open access” and was able to download fifty-two articles to use as my dataset.
My second step was to compare one review paper on Special Needs Education to the LDA results.(https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1126490.pdf)

### Data Preprocessing  
#### Data Loading
1. Data was loaded to the Jupyter notebook and all texts from 52 pdfs were extracted and saved under a single list.

2. In the next step, I convert this list to the data frame with 'paper text' as a column of the dataframe.This will be
 used for further preprocessing. 
#### Data cleaning:
1. Cleaning the data involves removing punctuations and converting all text to lowercase.Here I remove all the 
characters except the alphabet letters and the lowercase all the text using `re(regular expression library)` from Python.
2. The processed data is added to the data frame under a separate column, with a name “paper_ text_processed”.
#### Preparing data for LDA analysis
1. Removing the stopwords: This is the most important step of the whole pipeline as we prepare the final data for 
LDA training. First, NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) “stopwords” package is used to remove the meaningless words that
the search engine is programmed to ignore. We would not want these words to take up space in our database
or take longer processing time.
2. Additional to the default list that the package contains, later the list was further
extended with most common shared terms, as well as the words has no meaning,for instance: 'use','doi','sen','et','al' etc.
throughout the 20 topics based on LDA results.Otherwise, this would lead to the problem of not being able to capture 
all possible topics within the text and resulting the same word list for each topic.
3. “simple_preprocess” package is used for tokenization of text, where the text is split into sentences and later to words.
4.  Tokenized object is converted into a corpus and dictionary metrics. 


#  -------------------------------------------------------
### LDA Training 
1. We should decide the number of topics for analysis of the LDA model training result. 
`corpus`, `id2words`(a dictionary that maps the word “id” to a token ),
`num_topic`(number of topics) are passed as arguments to the LDA model training in a first trial.
#### Improving the LDA performance
After several trials and analysis of the results two more parameters are chosen to improve the result. 
1. Parameter `alpha='asymmetric'` is used to capture the different characteristics of the documents in the corpus.
2. Parameter `passes` is used to define the number of iteration.The number of passes refers to the number of times 
the algorithm goes through the entire dataset. More passes over the data allow the algorithm to converge on better 
topic mixtures, but also increases the computational cost and runtime.
3. `id2word.filter_extremes` method is used to filter out the words, as it removes rare and overly common words that are 
unlikely to be useful for identifying topics in the text. 

#### Visualisation of LDA results
For visualisation purposes `pyLDAvis` which is a package is used for visualizing and interpreting the topics.
It plots the `Intertopic Distance Map` and visualizes the most 30 relevant words for chosen number of topics.
The circles represent each topic. The distance between the circles visualizes topic relatedness. 
These are mapped through dimensionality reduction (PCA/t-sne) on distances between each topic’s probability distributions into 2D space.
This shows whether our model developed distinct topics.


#  -------------------------------------------------------


### Results and Analysis
1. Running the LDA model with default stopwords in English language from `stopwords`package:
As a result we get the exact same words dominating for all 20 topics and also observing some words that have no meaning
for the result interpretation.For example: 'al','et','doi','sen' etc. 
Model is not properly identifying distinct topics within text data.In order to tackle this problem, we need to further 
**preprocess the data** or **adjusting the Hyperparameters** of the model.
2. Running the model  with parameter  `alpha` and extended `stopwords` list:
Parameter `alpha='asymmetric'` is used to capture the different characteristics of the documents in the corpus,
allowing for more flexibility in modeling the data.It allows for different levels of sparsity for different topics,
depending on the specific characteristics of the data.
Using extended list of `stopwords` to remove the meaningless words that observed as a result of previous trial.
As a result we get most of the circles representing the topics are overlapping due to the high number of common words
for all topics, which means that `alpha='asymmetric'` parameter may not improve the result. On the other hand,meaningless 
words were removed from the text as a result of extended stopwords list.
After looking into top 10 word of each topic, following words were found to be appearing in all the topics:
[education, special, children, students, teachers, school]
It means that if the same terms are appearing in multiple topics, it can be difficult to understand the unique context
and meaning of each topic. Having these results in hand we cannot contextualize each of the topics in a distinct manner. 
3. Running the model with including the commonly shared words among the topics to extended `stopwords` list:
Additionally, I added a parameter `passes` to train the LDA for more iteration . 
I plotted the word similarity among 20 topics based on 10 top words for each topic. Most of the words from all topics
are still common by 30%-50%.Manually adding all the stopwords to the list would be a tedious task.Therefore, in the next
step I am using a function/method to automatically define a threshold to remove the most common and most rare words from 
the text.
4. Running a model with a method from the `gensim` library for filtering out words: As mentioned in **Improving LDA model
performance** section above,this method is typically used before training a topic model, as it removes rare and overly 
common words that are unlikely to be useful for identifying topics in the text. By keeping only the most common words 
that appear in a sufficient number of documents, the method aims to improve the performance of the topic model by 
focusing on the most meaningful words in the text.
As a result of using this method, unique number of words increased to 157 among all the topics,where 2 words seems 
to be appearing in only 4 topics, 7 words are observed in 3 topics ,23 words appears in 2 topics and the rest of the words
are almost unique for each different topics in dataset.Moreover, a decline in word similarity to 7% was also noticed 
among all topics in word similarity plot.

The words "educators", "Sweden", "Swedish" suggests that this topic is discussing the specific approach and strategies used by educators in Sweden when working with children with special needs. From the the words "consultation" and "tools" we may assume that this topic may be discussing the methods and strategies that educators use to consult with parents and other experts to provide effective support for children with special needs in Sweden, or some tools that could be of help with this children. 

### Topic 15 : Inormed decision making in specail needs education
Topic 15: 'choice', 'collaborative', 'provision', 'parental', 'search', 'real', 'placement', 'category', 'informed', 'decision'
These are more general words that can be found also in other topics and is hard to drive any conlusion from, however, we can assume that it is mostly about the concept of choice, collaborative provision, and informed decision-making in special needs education.The word "category" may suggest that the topic may be discussing the classification of children with special needs and the provision of services that are appropriate for the specific needs of each child. The words of "informed" and "decision" may be about the involvement of children and parents in the decision-making process and providing them with the information they need to make informed choices about their education.

### Short analysis 

Looking back at my research question and what the LDA model has generated, I can assume that with the help of some additional attempts, it was possible to find out the topics/themes that are discussed in the selected articles, although in some topics, some words seem to be reappearing and made it hard to extract meaning. However, in almost every topic, there are specific words shaping the topic's central context in this analysis. On the other hand, I am not sure how it could have been possible with a large dataset to extract meaning or name each topic accordingly, with many repetitive words.
As a summary, the first part of my research question (What are the most discussed themes/topics) is mostly answered. From the numbered topic words above, we can see the most discussed themes in the open-access articles, ranging from autism spectrum to hyperactivity, and parent-teacher relationship to home support, technology assistant teaching to the transformation of special needs children from school to job environment. In addition, the topics that I was particularly interested in (parental involvement in special needs education)seem to be appearing as well in many of the topics. Another part of my research question (the most prominent special needs education issues in European countries), has been answered partly, as the focus was more on northern countries, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Germany. Therefore, it is hard to generalize the topics for all European countries, as the context may fail to be very relevant for every country. It could be related to the infrastructural, and bureaucratic reasons in other European countries. Unfortunately, special needs education has yet to receive the required attention in every educational system, because of the shortage of experts in the fields, lack of governmental support, and financial issues. The countries that have been giving a great deal of attention to special needs education recently, are obviously focusing on more research and studies in this field based on their experience. 


How do the results relate to possible prior and related work? (https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1126490.pdf)

The paper is called  ”Review of the Literature on Children with Special Educational Needs”. 
This paper discusses the literature related to present research on special needs education. The review divided into four sections, and covers the most important issues in special needs education. 
The first section refers to cross-cultural factors, as its broader spectrum, it covers a lot of problems. 
The second part gives information on legislation about special needs education around the world, major changes and development since the establishment of Special Needs Education legislation. 
The third part led light how the main terminology seem to refer to the same issues even though they are formed differently in USA, Canada, and Europe, what trends and changes have been observed in special needs education concepts and terms e.g., “mental handicapped”, “mental deficiency”, “intellectual disability” and so on. 
When comparing this review paper to the LDA result of 52 articles, we may encounter with some identical patterns within cross-cultural discipline and usage of various terminology, although the LDA results mainly describe the situation in Special needs education in Europe, whereas the review paper gives more overall picture since the establishment of Special needs education legislation/concepts around the world. 
The parental involvement that has been detected a lot in LDA result, has not been noticed in this revies paper as a main subject of topic. Instead, different models of disability (disability mode, medical model, social model. )have been categorized accordingly, which can easily be interpreted and applied to the situation of children in Special needs education. 
In the section of Pedagogy of Special needs education, the key factors have been touched upon in the review paper which most of them could be observed within the  LDA result as well. 
The individual education plan is the most discussed topic according to both LDA result, and the review paper. It has been one of the most effective learning strategies based on individual learning which a teacher can employ in the planning of educational procedures to meet the difficulties faced by students with intellectual disabilities (Hawsawi, 2002).

Articles' summaries with key points:

1.(Topic 5) Positive attitudes toward home schooling, particularly during COVID 19, the suggestion of creating more opportunities for teachers professional development with working special needs students

2.The results of the study showed that the teachers had positive attitudes and self-efficacy beliefs towards at-risk students during home learning

3.The study aimed to investigate the assessment conception patterns of Finnish preservice special needs teachers and how their prior studies and teaching experience influenced these patterns. 

4.The study suggests that teacher education programs should include more training on assessment and provide opportunities for preservice teachers to develop their own assessment practices.

5. (Topic 12) Finnish approach/Finnish study on special needs education review the literature on mathematics interventions for primary school students with intellectual disabilities. The results showed that the interventions had positive effects on the mathematics performance of students with intellectual disabilities, the study highlights the need for more research on effective mathematics interventions for students with special needs and the importance of tailoring interventions to individual student’s needs. 

6.Another study aimed to investigate how Finnish primary school teachers experience their role and competences implementing the three-tiered support model for students with special educational needs. The model has both benefits and challenges for teachers and suggested the collaboration between teachers and other professionals. The challenges included a lack of time, resources and trainings, as well as concerns about stigmatization and labeling of students. This study also suggests the need for further training and support for teachers to effectively implement the model. 

7.(Topic 6) Another study in Sweden on reading among young L1 and L2 students in Sweden aimed to investigate the reading skills of young students who speak Swedish as their first(L1) and second (L2) languages. According to the results, the L1 students performed better than L2 students in all aspects of reading, including vocabulary and comprehension. The study highlights the importance of providing support and resources for L2 students to improve their reading skills and succeed academically.

8. (Topic 20) In one article, the challenges faced by Norwegian educational-psychological advisers in capturing the needs of students through collaboration were explored. The importance of collaboration between advisers, teachers, and parents in identifying and meeting the needs of students are the key points of study. The study revealed several challenges, including insufficient time for collaboration, limited access to students' records, and difficulties in coordinating with other professionals. The need for increased collaboration, better information systems, and improved training for educational-psychological advisers to better meet the needs of students are the main takeaways. 

9. (Topic 10) The article explores the challenges faced by teachers in supporting autistic pupils in different school settings and the strategies they use to overcome them. The study highlights the importance of teacher self-efficacy in supporting autistic pupils and the need for ongoing professional development to support teachers in their roles. Establishing a structured and predictable routine to create a stable environment for the autistic pupils and developing a strong relationship with the pupil and their family to better understand their needs and preferences, as well as providing clear and consistent communication to ensure that the pupil understands what is expected of them, using visual aids and assistive technology to support communication and learning were the key strategies that showed positive result on student. 

10. The importance of creating an optimal environment for inclusive education through co-location and interdisciplinary collaboration is discussed. The authors argue that successful collaboration requires changes in the attitudes, behavior, and structures of organizations. They suggest that co-location of special and general education services can facilitate collaboration and enable a more efficient use of resources. The article highlights the importance of creating a shared vision for inclusive education and the need for ongoing professional development.

11. (Topic 6) Another study involved a large group of children from the general population who were assessed at different stages of development. The results showed that children with language problems were at increased risk of emotional and behavioral difficulties compared to typically developing children. The study highlights the importance of early identification and intervention for children with language problems to prevent the development of emotional and behavioral difficulties. 

12. The article explores the experiences of teachers studying special education in a dual system, in which they simultaneously work as teachers and study special education. The authors used qualitative interviews to gather data from 22 Swedish teachers, and identified four main themes: motivation for studying special education, perceived benefits and drawbacks of the dual system, challenges in balancing work and study, and the impact of the dual system on professional development. The authors conclude that the dual system can be both motivating and challenging for teachers, and that teacher education programs should consider the needs of teachers studying special education in a dual system.

13. (Topic 16)The article discusses the professionalization of learning and support assistants (LSAs) and its impact on collaboration with teachers and other professionals in inclusive educational settings. The authors used a mixed-methods approach to investigate changes in collaboration as a result of the professionalization of LSAs. The study found that professionalization of LSAs led to positive changes in collaboration, including increased communication and collaboration with teachers and other professionals, improved knowledge and skills, and enhanced confidence and self-efficacy. The authors suggest that further research is needed to explore the long-term impact of LSA professionalization on inclusive educational practices.

14. The article explores the assessment conceptions and self-efficacy of pre-service special needs teachers. The study found that the participants had a varied understanding of assessment and different levels of self-efficacy in their assessment skills. The participants also indicated a need for more training in assessment practices, particularly in relation to special needs students. The study highlights the importance of providing adequate training and support to pre-service special needs teachers to improve their assessment skills and ensure that they can effectively meet the needs of their students.

15. (Topic 15)Buli-Holmberg et al. (2022) conducted a qualitative literature review on the implementation of inclusion practices in Nordic countries. The study identified common themes such as the importance of teacher collaboration, the need for training and support, and the challenges in implementing inclusion in practice. The authors found that while there is a strong commitment to inclusion in the Nordic countries, there are still barriers to full implementation, such as the lack of resources and support for students with special needs. The study highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the implementation of inclusive practices in Nordic countries and beyond.

16. Ryökkynen et al. (2022) conducted a study on pride and shame in students with special needs in Finnish Vocational Education and Training (VET). The study aimed to explore how these students experience and express pride and shame in their learning and social situations. The authors found that the students experienced pride in achieving their goals, receiving recognition and support, and developing their skills. However, they also experienced shame in situations where they felt they were not meeting expectations or were being compared to others. The study highlights the need for VET professionals to provide supportive learning environments that encourage students' pride and minimize feelings of shame. The authors suggest that a strengths-based approach to education could help to foster pride and self-esteem in students with special needs.

17. (Topic 10) Tansley et al. (2022) conducted a scoping review on the use of intense interests to support inclusion and learning for secondary-aged autistic pupils in schools. The study found that intense interests could be used as a tool to support inclusion and learning by promoting engagement, motivation, and social connections for autistic pupils. The authors identified three main approaches to using intense interests in schools, which include integrating interests into the curriculum, using interests to support social connections, and using interests to develop employability skills. However, the study also identified some challenges to using intense interests, such as difficulties in identifying and accommodating interests, and the potential for interests to become all-consuming and interfere with learning. The study highlights the potential benefits of incorporating intense interests into educational programs for autistic students and suggests the need for further research on effective strategies for doing so.

18. The article "How does the association between special education need and absence vary overtime and across special education need types?" by Lereya et al. (2022) explores the relationship between special education needs (SEN) and student absenteeism over time and across different types of SEN. The study used data from a longitudinal study of over 6,000 children in England, analyzing their attendance and SEN status at ages 5, 7, 11, and 14.
The authors found that children with SEN had higher rates of absence than their peers without SEN, and that this relationship persisted over time. Additionally, the study identified variations in absence rates across different types of SEN, with children with emotional and behavioral difficulties (EBD) having the highest rates of absence. The authors suggest that the findings highlight the importance of providing targeted support to children with SEN, particularly those with EBD, to help improve their attendance and educational outcomes.

19. (Topic 18) The article explores the reasons why secondary students with visual impairments leave mainstream schools in Germany. The authors conducted interviews with students, parents, and professionals to identify the factors that contribute to this trend. The study found that the reasons for leaving mainstream schooling were often related to a lack of targeted support for students with visual impairments, negative attitudes from peers and teachers, and the physical environment of the school.

After looking the key points in each article, I decided to review the whole set of articles in four categories, in order not to avoid any details. 

Articles 1-21:
The articles reviewed in this summary cover a variety of topics related to special education in Nordic countries mainly. A recurring theme across several articles is the importance of providing adequate training and support to teachers, especially in the area of assessment. Studies highlight the need for ongoing professional development to support teachers in their roles and improve their self-efficacy in supporting special needs students which is not observed, or could no tbe extracted from LDA results.
Other studies address the challenges faced by teachers in supporting students with specific needs, such as autism and language problems(which can easily be observed in LDA result). The importance of establishing a structured and predictable routine to create a stable environment for students and developing a strong relationship with the student and their family is emphasized. Several studies examine the implementation of inclusive practices in Nordic countries and highlight the importance of collaboration between teachers, educational-psychological advisers, and parents in identifying and meeting the needs of students. Co-location of special and general education services is seen as a way to facilitate collaboration and enable a more efficient use of resources.
The importance of early identification and intervention for children with language problems is emphasized in one study, which found that these students are at increased risk of emotional and behavioral difficulties compared to typically developing children.
The professionalization of learning and support assistants (LSAs) is another topic covered in several articles, which is not found or was hard to analyze according to the LDA result. The study found that professionalization of LSAs led to positive changes in collaboration with teachers and other professionals in inclusive educational settings.
Overall, the studies reviewed highlight the need for ongoing training and support for teachers to effectively support special needs students and promote inclusive practices in Nordic countries. Collaborative efforts between teachers, educational-psychological advisers, and parents are crucial in identifying and meeting the needs of students. Early identification and intervention for students with specific needs can prevent the development of emotional and behavioral difficulties.
